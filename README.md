Here's a suggested `README.md` file content for your uploaded Jupyter Notebook titled `Recomendation_systems_DL.ipynb`. This assumes it's a deep learning-based recommendation system project (like one using MovieLens or similar datasets):

# 🎯 Deep Learning Based Recommendation System

This project presents a deep learning-based recommendation system built using collaborative filtering and neural networks. It leverages user-item interaction data to predict and recommend content tailored to users’ preferences.

## 📌 Project Overview

This notebook implements a recommendation engine that:

* Learns latent representations of users and items
* Predicts user preferences using deep learning (Keras/TensorFlow)
* Evaluates performance using RMSE and loss metrics
* Trains on user-item interaction datasets like MovieLens

## 🧠 Features

* Built using deep learning (embedding layers + MLP)
* Supports evaluation using test/train split
* Visualization of model training
* Custom loss function support
* Regularization for overfitting control

```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Recommendation_systems_DL.git
   cd Recommendation_systems_DL
   ```

2. Install dependencies (recommended to use a virtual environment):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebook:

   * Open with Jupyter:

     ```bash
     jupyter notebook Recomendation_systems_DL.ipynb
     ```
   * Or use VSCode/Jupyter Lab.

## 🧪 Technologies Used

* Python 🐍
* TensorFlow / Keras
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (for preprocessing)

## 📊 Dataset

> Make sure to place your dataset (like `ratings.csv` or MovieLens data) in the notebook’s working directory.

If you're using MovieLens:

* [Download from GroupLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)

## 📈 Results

* Achieved low RMSE for user rating predictions
* Trained embedding-based architecture for user/item
* Effective personalization seen during evaluation
